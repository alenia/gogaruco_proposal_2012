## Notes and slides for GoGaRuCo talk.
I'm using fork of deck.rb that includes MathJax. Eventually I will try to
move my JS and CSS out of there and into this project.

## How to run:

To start the slide server, run:

    bundle exec deck slides.rb

and hit localhost:4333 to view the slides.

Unfortunately, due to the fact that I'm keeping all of my js and css in my fork
of deck.rb, you'll have to bundle update when I make changes to that
fork.

## Other things in this repo:

I have notes in the notes directory (surprise!) Mostly these are from
early on in writing this talk. slides_draft.md is some old work
regarding using the binomial coefficient. I'm going to move my typed-up
version of my talk into here sometime soon.
