# Proposal

Breaking concepts down into logical chunks, tackling them in isolation,
etc... Sound familiar? This is how we write tests but it is also how a
mathematician writes proofs. Exploring the similarities and differences
between teh two can bring us back to our profession's mathematical
roots.
In this talk, we will look at mathematical proofs and Ruby code
side-by-side in an effort ot uncover why these sorts of puzzles are
appealing.  I'll explain a few mathematical 'methods' through Ruby code,
but don't worry, no math background is required.

We'll examine summation notation-- the mathematical loop, as well as the
multiple ways of defining the Binomial Coefficient. (Refresher: remember
`n choose k`?) After that, I'll translate a basic proof by induction
into pseudo-RSpec in order to highlight the similarities between writing
a test and writing a proof, such as the existance of stubs.

When you leave this talk, you'll have a better understanding about what
you love about test driving, and perhaps you'll learn some math in the
process.
